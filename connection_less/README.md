The organization for this portion of the data is not nearly as uniform as for the connection oriented data sets. The original intention was to repeat the connection-less tests for different Android versions for comparison. Under the Android 7 directory the data files are organized such that the test parameters are found in the directory names. The packet arrival files (scan logs) are essentially just a list of nanosecond timestamps. The bt logs are from the hci snoop logs and there is an android bugreport for recovering energy consumption.
